## Questions

- Lights
  - How many can I control and at what brightness?
  - How do I wire them up?
  - How do I mount them? (tape vs supports)
- Enclosure
  - Do I need white filament for the backing to improve the light diffusion?
  - How do I attach the front image to the rest of the enclosure? (friction, bolts, glue)
- Front image
  - How do I keep the paper/diffuser in place?
