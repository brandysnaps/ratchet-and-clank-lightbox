I spent a little time today getting [Octoprint][octoprint] installed and running on an old Raspberry Pi model B I had lying around. Octoprint will let me monitor the printing process remotely and create timelapses of any prints I make. I would like to include a timelapse of printing this project as I think it would be a nice touch.

The camera module I have was suprisinly easy to set up. I will have to figure out how to mount the camera to properly view the print bed, but that will come later (once I've actually built the printer ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

The one concern I have it that my Rasperry Pi model B is old and may struggle to run Octoprint. The website recommends model 3 onwards.
