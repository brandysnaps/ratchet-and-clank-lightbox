Well, there you have it. It's been a whirlwind who knows how long trying to get this ready 😅.

## To my brother

Happy 21st birthday! You are hands down, one of the best people I have the privilege of knowing and it's been such a joy watching you grow. I will forever cherish the memories I have of us bonding over Ratchet & Clank.

I hope this lightbox makes a fitting addition to your room. Given everything I have learned working on this project, if you want anything tweaked, let me know 😁.

Love you lots,

Brands
