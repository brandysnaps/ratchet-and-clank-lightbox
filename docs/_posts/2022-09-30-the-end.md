Well, there you have it. After 20 hours making this website, 20 hours printing and countless more hours thinking, designing and making, I have reached the end of the project. It's been a whirlwind trying to get this ready 😅.

Everything is packaged and now ready to present to my brother:

## To my brother

Happy 21st birthday! I cannot believe you have reached this milestone already. You are hands down, one of the best people I have the privilege of knowing and it's been such a joy watching you grow. I will forever cherish the memories I have of us bonding over Ratchet & Clank.

I hope this lightbox makes a fitting addition to your room. Given everything I have learned working on this project, if you want anything tweaked, let me know 😁.

Love you lots,

Brands
