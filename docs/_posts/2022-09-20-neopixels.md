My goal for today is to be able to control a strip of NeoPixel LEDs using the Raspberry Pi Pico.

I found the [NeoPixel LEDs][adafruit] post on Adafruit's website that seems to be exactly what I want to do.

The first thing I did was cut my LED strip to the correct size (30 LEDs) and grabbed some wires to let me control the strip to the header pins on the Pico.

## Wiring the NeoPixel LED Strip

I wired everything up as follows:

## Installing the Adafruit CircuitPython NeoPixel Library

Once that was done, I downloaded CircuitPython for the Pico. This was a UF2 file. I held down the **BOOTSEL** button on the Pico before plugging it into my laptop. This brought it up as a drive labelled `RPI-RP2`. I dragged the UF2 file to the new drive. After a couple of seconds, it reappeared with the name `CIRCUITPY`. Apparently this means CircuitPython is successfully installed ðŸŽ‰.

The next step was to download the necessary library to use the NeoPixels. I copied the `neopixel.mpy` file to the `lib` directory as instructed by the docs. I then replaced the contents of the `code.py` file with the following:

```python

"""
NeoPixel example for Pico. Turns the NeoPixels red.

REQUIRED HARDWARE:
* RGB NeoPixel LEDs connected to pin GP0.
"""
import board
import neopixel

# Update this to match the number of NeoPixel LEDs connected to your board.
num_pixels = 30

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.GP0, num_pixels)
pixels.brightness = 0.5

while True:
    pixels.fill((255, 0, 0))
```

I wasn't really expecting anything to happen but after saving the file, to my surprise:

Even at 50%, these things are bright.

## Animations

The next thing I want to look at is creating some animations based around the blue and pink colour scheme my brother likes.

This looks like a good place to start: [CircuitPython LED Animations][animations]
